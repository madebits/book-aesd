Tango is a very sensual dance where the male and female partners stay closer to each-other that other couple dances, e.g., waltz or swing. Interestingly, the origin of Tango is in Argentina as a dance practiced by exclusively only by men during their work breaks. The dance was considered too offensive for women, and only prostitutes could originally dare to dance it. Today Tango is a widely accepted classic-like kind of dance.
